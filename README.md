# gp120_unfolding

# title

comparative thermal unfolding study of gp120 from HIV-1 isolates with different neutralization-sensitivity phenotype by molecular dynamics simulations

# aims
1. release the differences of H061.14- and R2-gp120 in structural deviation, unfolding content and conformational diversity.
2. find the mutations response to differences in conformational diversity.
